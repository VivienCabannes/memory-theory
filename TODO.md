- Create experiments that shows EOS.
- Create experiments that explores memory erasing.

- Would be nice to add support to compute the `empirical NTK`.

- If we want to check the Hessian for more complex models, we need to check how to do so in pytorch. We can probably look at the code of others that study hessian related properties, or check the `functorch` library of `pytorch`. See also https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/49171.
